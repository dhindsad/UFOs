# UFOs


Overview:
  - The purpose of this analysis was to help create a webpage and dynamic table along with allowing users to filter multiple criteria at a time.
  
  
Results:
  - The search can be performed by entering the desired datetime, city, shape, state, or country in the filter form. Multiple filters can be selected at one time to narrow the search.

Summary:
  - One disadvantage of the new code that after using multiple filters at a time, the table removes all the filters on going back. This is a disadvantage because the user needs to enter the filter all over again. 
  - I would recommend developing the webpage so that it takes the user back to the filters he entered instead of clearing the filters and other would be to showcase in someway date range, so that the user knows the date range he has to select from.
